# Rust MyGram
This API is taken from my old project called "h8-mygram" which was the final project for the Hacktiv8 Go Course and has been converted into Rust.

It's not perfect, but it can be used as a blueprint if I decide to start a new project.

### Requirements
- Rust >= v1.82
- PostgreSQL >= v16
- Doa >= Segalanya
